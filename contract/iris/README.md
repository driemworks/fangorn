# IRIS

IRIS is the **I**ntent **R**egistry **I**ntegration **S**ervice. 

It acts as a bulletin board for intents, where unique global 'filenames' can be used to define ciphertext location and intent. It is open and permisionless, allowing anyone to register a new file, CID and intent bytes. The intent encodes data parsed by Fangorn workers to determine a relevant `gadget`. It is agnostic of actual intent structure and is not responsible for parsing intent data.
