# IRIS

Iris is a basic intent store that acts as a bulletin board. It is open and permisionless, allowing anyone to register a new file, CID and intent bytes. The intent encodes data parsed by Fangorn workers to determine a relevant `gadget`. It is agnostic of actual intent structure and is not responsible for parsing intent data.
